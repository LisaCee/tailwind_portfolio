				<p class=''>
					I spent over a decade helping public library users interact
					with challenging websites and programs. Over the years, I
					collected an arsenal of tips and techniques to aid users
					when things didn&apos;t work as they should. Rather than
					continuing to triage these issues for individual users, I
					decided to become a part of the solution. While my
					background is in JavaScript and React, my first development
					job was in PHP and WordPress. I am eager for new challenges
					and I like to learn through experimentation and asking
					questions as needed. I prefer to be nudged in the right
					direction rather than be given the solution. I find it
					helpful to understand why things work the way they do,
					rather than just accepting that they work. I work hard and I
					am eager to make a meaningful impact by creating accessible
					tools for all software users. The diverse cultural, age, and
					economic backgrounds I encountered at the library give me a
					unique perspective on creating technology with the user in
					mind. When I am offline I enjoy reading fiction, listening
					to Prince, and watching superhero movies.
